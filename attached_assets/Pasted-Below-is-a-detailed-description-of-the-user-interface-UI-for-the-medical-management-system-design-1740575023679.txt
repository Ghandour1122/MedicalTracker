Below is a detailed description of the user interface (UI) for the medical management system, designed to provide the UI/UX team with a clear starting point. The system supports three main user roles—Project Owner, Doctors, and Patients—each with distinct interfaces tailored to their needs. The goal is to create an intuitive, secure, and efficient experience that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

Components:

Quick action buttons: "Add New Doctor," "View Reports," "Backup Database."
Layout: Metrics in cards at the top, quick actions below.
Doctor Management
Doctor List:
